# Comms Module

## Purpose

End-to-end communications system covering brand positioning, content planning, generation, scheduling, engagement, landing pages, ads, and analytics. Built on StoryBrand (Donald Miller) and Tribal Marketing (Seth Godin) frameworks. Customer is the HERO; your brand is the GUIDE.

## Quick Start

> Say "quarterly campaign plan" to create a campaign strategy, or "approve content" to review pending drafts.

## How It Works

### Framework Hierarchy

```
STRATEGIC  — Smallest Viable Audience, StoryBrand, Purple Cow, Permission Marketing
CONTENT    — 8 Content Types, STEPPS Viral Checklist, Viral Patterns, Weekly Calendar
EXECUTION  — Platform formatting, Voice Enforcement, Viral score gate (8+/11)
```

### Content Pipeline

1. **Position** — BrandScript, voice guidelines, tribe profile
2. **Plan** — Quarterly strategy, monthly calendar (8 content types rotated)
3. **Generate** — Platform-specific posts using viral patterns + datacortex zettels
4. **Enforce** — Voice check + STEPPS viral checklist (score 8+ to publish)
5. **Verify** — All URLs return HTTP 200 with real content
6. **Schedule** — Publishing queue via Tweepy/nightshift or manual approval
7. **Analyze** — PostHog metrics, conversion reports, A/B tests

### Engagement Pipeline

Discovery of X conversations, reply drafting, Telegram-based approval, posting. Also Chrome-based feed engagement (likes, follows, reply drafts).

### Module vs Content (Critical)

- **Module** (`.datacore/modules/comms/`) = system code, agents, docs — stays clean
- **Content** (space folders) = campaigns, drafts, posted — grows with use. All generated content goes to space folders.

## Key Paths

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `1-tracks/comms/positioning/` | Brand voice, messaging (input) |
| `1-tracks/comms/campaigns/{quarter}/{month}/` | Strategy, calendar, drafts, approved, posted |
| `1-tracks/comms/reports/` | Daily, weekly, A/B test reports |
| `3-knowledge/zettel/` | Topic zettels for content generation |

## Setup

Optional env vars in `.datacore/env/.env`: `X_CONSUMER_KEY`, `X_CONSUMER_SECRET`, `X_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `X_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET`, `XAI_API_KEY`, `POSTHOG_API_KEY`, `POSTHOG_PROJECT_KEY`, `NEYNAR_API_KEY`, `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, `MEDIUM_TOKEN`.

## Boundaries

- Landing page **content** is created here; server **deployment** is handled by the `dev` module.
- Does NOT handle direct email campaigns (see `mail` module).
- Human approval required by default (`auto_post: false`).
