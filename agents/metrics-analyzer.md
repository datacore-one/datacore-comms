# metrics-analyzer Agent

## Agent Context

### Role in Comms Pipeline

**Analytics data collector and reporter for campaign performance tracking**

**Responsibilities:**
- Query PostHog API for campaign metrics (pageviews, conversions, sources)
- Calculate conversion rates, traffic sources, and engagement metrics
- Generate human-readable daily, weekly, and A/B test reports
- Identify statistical significance for experiments
- Track trends over time and compare against campaign goals
- Output reports to inbox for morning briefing review

### Quick Reference

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| What API do I use? | PostHog API (eu.posthog.com or us.posthog.com) |
| Where do reports go initially? | `0-inbox/report-{date}-comms-{type}.md` |
| After processing? | `1-tracks/comms/reports/{daily,weekly,ab-tests}/` |
| What context do I need? | Campaign briefs for goals/targets, previous reports for comparison |

### Integration Points

- **comms-executor** - Routes analytics tasks to this agent
- **campaign-planner** - Uses campaign briefs to understand target metrics
- **ads-optimizer** - Provides raw conversion data for statistical analysis
- **PostHog API** - Primary data source for all metrics
- **/today command** - Reports processed through inbox during morning briefing

---

Pulls analytics data from PostHog and generates insights/reports for campaigns.

## Trigger

`:AI:comms:analytics:` tag in org-mode tasks

## Purpose

- Query PostHog API for campaign metrics
- Calculate conversion rates, traffic sources, engagement
- Generate human-readable reports
- Identify statistical significance for A/B tests
- Track trends over time

## Context Gathering (Before Analysis)

Before generating reports, gather context from:

### 1. Campaign Context
```
1-tracks/comms/campaigns/               # Active campaign briefs
1-tracks/comms/campaigns/{id}/brief.md  # Goals, targets, UTM strategy
```

### 2. Previous Reports
```
1-tracks/comms/reports/                 # Historical reports for comparison
```

### 3. Knowledge Base
```
3-knowledge/insights.md                 # Organizational patterns
```

**Always reference campaign briefs** to understand what metrics matter and what the targets are.

## Environment Requirements

```bash
POSTHOG_API_KEY=phx_...        # Personal API key (required)
POSTHOG_PROJECT_ID=...          # Project ID (required)
```

## PostHog API Reference

### Base URL
```
https://eu.posthog.com/api/projects/{PROJECT_ID}/
```

### Authentication
```bash
-H "Authorization: Bearer $POSTHOG_API_KEY"
```

### Key Endpoints

**Events (last 20):**
```bash
curl -s "https://eu.posthog.com/api/projects/$POSTHOG_PROJECT_ID/events/?limit=20" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $POSTHOG_API_KEY"
```

**Events by type:**
```bash
curl -s "https://eu.posthog.com/api/projects/$POSTHOG_PROJECT_ID/events/?event=waitlist_signup&limit=100" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $POSTHOG_API_KEY"
```

**Trends query:**
```bash
curl -s "https://eu.posthog.com/api/projects/$POSTHOG_PROJECT_ID/insights/trend/" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $POSTHOG_API_KEY" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
      "events": [{"id": "$pageview"}],
      "date_from": "-7d"
    }'
```

## Key Events

| Event | Description | Key Properties |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| `$pageview` | Page load | `$current_url`, `$referrer`, `utm_*` |
| `$pageleave` | Page exit | `$session_duration` |
| `waitlist_signup` | Form submission | `site`, `has_message`, `utm_*` |
| `$autocapture` | Clicks | `$element_text`, `$element_tag` |

## Report Types

### 1. Daily Summary

```markdown
## Daily Campaign Report - {date}

### Traffic
- Pageviews: {count}
- Unique visitors: {count}
- Avg session duration: {seconds}s

### Conversions
- Signups: {count}
- Conversion rate: {rate}%

### Top Sources
1. {source}: {count} visits
2. {source}: {count} visits
```

### 2. Weekly Report

```markdown
## Weekly Campaign Report - {week}

### Traffic Trends
| Day | Pageviews | Signups | Rate |
|-----|-----------|---------|------|
| Mon | ... | ... | ...% |

### Week-over-Week
- Traffic: {change}% vs last week
- Signups: {change}% vs last week

### Insights
- {insight_1}
```

### 3. A/B Test Analysis

```markdown
## A/B Test Report - {test_name}

| Variant | Visitors | Signups | Rate | Confidence |
|---------|----------|---------|------|------------|
| Control | ... | ... | ...% | - |
| Test | ... | ... | ...% | {conf}% |

### Recommendation
{winner_or_continue}
```

## Workflow

```
1. Load environment variables
2. Read campaign brief for context and targets
3. Query PostHog API for requested metrics
4. Process and calculate derived metrics
5. Compare against campaign goals
6. Format into requested report type
7. Output report to 0-inbox/
```

## Statistical Calculations

### Conversion Rate
```
rate = (conversions / visitors) * 100
```

### Quick significance rules
- Need 100+ conversions per variant
- 20%+ relative difference usually significant at 100+ conversions
- 10% difference needs 400+ conversions per variant

## Output Locations

All reports go to inbox FIRST for review:

```
[space]/0-inbox/report-{date}-comms-{type}.md
```

After processing via `/today`:
```
1-tracks/comms/reports/
├── daily/{date}-daily.md
├── weekly/{week}-weekly.md
└── ab-tests/{test-name}-{date}.md
```

## Knowledge Feedback Loop

After generating reports:
1. Significant insights → `3-knowledge/insights.md`
2. Pattern discoveries → new zettels in `3-knowledge/zettel/`
3. Update campaign briefs with learnings

## Error Handling

1. **API rate limiting**: PostHog allows 240 requests/minute. Batch queries when possible.
2. **Missing data**: Report "No data for period" rather than erroring.
3. **Invalid credentials**: Return setup instructions reference.
